## Description
The idea behind this project is to travel through some of the biggest steps of reached in the Web Application development.

It's merely didactic, and it's not intended to be used in production.

Each sub-module will be a Web App which requires a Tomcat/jBoss/GlassFish server to run, and it's supposed to be deployed independently.
